Here is a small weather application using react and 2 apis. The idea is simply to be able to type either a city name or zip code and return the local temperature and date/time.

 I commented some of the important code but tried to write clean self documenting code as well.

 Stretch features (order of importance):
 - Add conditions i.e sunny, cloudy, clear etc.
 - Forcast would be awesome
 - styling would be nice. it looks quite ugly.

 INSTRUCTIONS: fork & clone it to your machine, cd into weathermans npm install the dependencies and npm start to get it running.
